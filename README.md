# Full Stack Learning
This repo is meant to be code and notes for full stack development of a microservices app. The repo will include the below. The order is when I created them
- Terraform - building the infra in AWS
- Ansible - building the hosts and installing/creating a kubernetes cluster
- Application - microservices app written in Go
- Istio - Service mesh config

There will be a folder for each section above.

# Environment
The README docs assume a Mac or Linux environment depending on whether the tool is being ran on a PC/laptop (Mac) or on a public cloud host (Linux).
